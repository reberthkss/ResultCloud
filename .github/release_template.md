Copy below text into a task and tick the items:

```
Some weeks before the release:
* [ ] Check if we should update the bundled sqlite3 (https://github.com/owncloud/client/tree/master/src/3rdparty/sqlite3)
* [ ] Check if we should update Sparkle on build machine (https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/releases)

* [ ] Ensure the crash reporter server is up
* [ ] Check crash reporter for bad crashes
* [ ] Review list of supported platforms. Announce/execute deprecations.
* [ ] Check daily builds are up and running, that is Jenkins.int jobs client-linux, client-osx and client-win32-msvc, client-win32--msvc-msi all green.
* [ ] Ensure Linux daily builds are built too for all distros https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/isv:ownCloud:desktop:daily:2.X/owncloud-client
* [ ] Build branded clients through the scripting machine and smoke test one or two branded clients (especially with predefined url)

For first Alpha/Beta of a Major or Minor release:
* [ ] branch off master to new version branch (e.g. master -> 2.1, when releasing 2.1)
* [ ] Adjust `VERSION.cmake` in master and count up (e.g. 2.2)
* [ ] Add the new branch v2.X.X for the new version to gitea/jw/client-linux-build
* [ ] Add the new version to gitea/ownbrander/scripting/client-linux/templates/client/2.X.X
* [ ] Add branch to branches.only section in appveyor.yml, so PRs to that branch will be built by AppVeyor
* [ ] Adjust translation jobs for [client](https://ci.owncloud.org/view/translation-sync/job/translation-sync-client/) to point to the release branch (e.g. 2.1).
* [ ] Make sure there is a job for the docs of the new master branch and the current release branch on rotor e.g. http://doc.owncloud.org/desktop/1.X/ exists

15 minutes after after release:
